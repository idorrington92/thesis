The sample includes GRBs detected by BATSE and by PVO. The energy range for BATSE was 50-300keV, and the energy range for PVO was 100-2000keV. For uniformly distributed GRBs, we expect this plot to have a gradient of $-3/2$. The expected gradient is observed for high energy GRBs but not at lower energies. This suggests a limited distance to which GRBs can be observed. \textbf {cite \url {https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Distribution-log-N-log-P-for-a-combined-set-of-BATSEPVO-data-The-distributions-match_fig5_242389649}} \textbf {cite \url {https://www.nature.com/articles/366040a0.pdf}} }}{13}{figure.3.3}

The top panel shows a histogram of the T90 data, which clearly has two populations of GRBs, short and long. The main plot shows T90 against spectral hardness, which makes the two populations even more clear and shows that short GRBs have harder spectra than long GRBs. Those GRBs with the greatest ratio of energy in the X-ray to gamma ray band, generally those with a peak energy of less than 15 keV, are called \textit {X-ray flashes} (XRF). Those with comparable energy in the gamma-ray and X-ray band are called \textit {X-ray rich} (XRR) GRBs. All other GRBs are simply called GRBs. These different classes of GRBs are marked on the plot. Also shown is the 2 second dividing line between short and long GRBs. \textbf {cite What are Gamma-ray Bursts? Joshua Bloom}}}{15}{figure.3.4}

This is because the spectra must have curvature, and so extrapolating a power law leads to an overestimation. The green dashed line shows the approximate detection threshold for the GBM.
